    "#### Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    To support iteration in our classes, we can implement two operator overloading methods: __iter__ and __next__. These methods enable our objects to be iterated over using a loop or other iterable operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "__iter__: This method allows our class to be iterable by returning an iterator object. The iterator object should have a __next__ method that defines the behavior for retrieving the next item in the iteration. The __iter__ method is called when the iteration is initialized, typically at the beginning of a loop. It should return the iterator object itself or initialize and return a new iterator object if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__next__: This method defines the behavior for retrieving the next item in the iteration sequence. It is called on the iterator object returned by the __iter__ method. The __next__ method should return the next item in the sequence and raise the StopIteration exception when there are no more items to iterate over.\n"

    "#### Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    The two operator overloading methods that are commonly used for managing printing in Python classes are __str__ and __repr__.\n",
    "\n",
    "__str__ method: This method is used to define a string representation of an object that is suitable for human consumption. It is called by the str() built-in function or by using the print() function. The __str__ method should return a string that provides a concise and readable description of the object's state or attributes. It is primarily intended for end-users and should prioritize readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "__repr__ method: This method is used to define a string representation of an object that is mainly used for debugging and development purposes. It is called by the repr() built-in function or by the interpreter when an object is evaluated in the REPL environment. The __repr__ method should return a string that provides a detailed and unambiguous representation of the object, including all necessary information to recreate the object if possible.\n",

    "#### Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    Operator overloading is appropriate to use when we want to define custom behavior for operators in our class objects. It allows we to redefine the default operations associated with operators, enabling more intuitive and expressive code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   appropriate to use operator overloading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Semantics: Operator overloading is commonly used when we want our class objects to exhibit behavior similar to built-in types. For example, if we have a custom class representing a complex number, we can overload operators like +, -, *, and / to perform arithmetic operations on complex numbers in a natural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Expressiveness: Operator overloading can enhance the readability and expressiveness of our code. By defining appropriate operator behavior, we can write code that closely resembles the mathematical or logical concepts our are working with. This can make our code more concise and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Data Structures: When working with custom data structures, operator overloading can provide a convenient way to interact with the data. For instance, if we have a custom linked list class, we can overload operators like [] for indexing or + for concatenation to make working with the linked list more intuitive.\n",

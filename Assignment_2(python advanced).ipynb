Modules provide a way to organize and structure code, making it more modular, reusable, and maintainable. By grouping related classes within a module, it becomes easier to locate and manage the code that is responsible for a particular set of functionality.\n",

In Python, this is typically achieved by implementing special methods or dunder methods, which are identified by double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (add for addition). These special methods define the behavior of operators when applied to instances of a class. For example, defining the __add__ method allows objects of a class to use the + operator for addition. Method overloading provides a flexible and intuitive way to customize the behavior of operators in Python classes."

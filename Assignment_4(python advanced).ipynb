    "An abstract superclass cannot be instantiated directly; it exists solely for the purpose of providing a common structure and behavior to its subclasses. It defines abstract methods, which are declared but not implemented in the superclass. These abstract methods serve as placeholders, indicating that the subclasses must provide their own implementation."

Class attributes are variables or values that are shared by all instances of the class.In Python, a class attribute is defined outside of any methods within the class, typically at the top level of the class definition. It is assigned a value just like any other variable assignment statement. When an instance of the class is created, it can access and modify the class attribute, but each instance does not have its own copy of the attribute. Instead, all instances share the same attribute defined at the class level."

This is typically done using the super() function, which returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing access to its methods and attributes."

Instance variables have a broader scope within the class, allowing them to be accessed and modified by other methods within the same class.\n",
